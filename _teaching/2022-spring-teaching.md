Spring Semester (3 cr.)  
This course reinforces and deepens economic skills by applying basic microeconomic concepts
and models to a variety of policy areas. Using economic models, students in the course will
examine the motivation for intervention in the economy, the types of intervention, and the
predicted effects of policies.  
Policy areas covered will include tax, social, health, regulatory, environmental, and trade policy,
among others. To better understand these issues, the course will first briefly discuss some of
the institutional details of the policy area, and then use economic models to examine impact of
policy on behavior and market outcomes.

What did you like most about this course and instructor?
> PROFESSOR FISHER IS AWESOME! She deserves more than this school will give her. She is so engaging, passionate, patient, empathetic, and so much more in this course, I can honestly say I’ve never been happier in an economics class. I also love the unique perspective she brings to issues in economics that most of the old white men I’ve encountered don’t have. 
> She was clearly passionate about our success and portrayed excitement at being responsible for our education. Very kind professor that kept the class concepts relevant and made a conscious and noticeable effort to clarify that there are multiple perspectives on every issue.
> The instructor had great enthusiasm  while teaching and it made it enjoyable to come to class. Lessons were matched perfectly with activities to grasp the knowledge.

What did you like least about this course and instructor?
> Nothing, I think this course had a good balance of quizzes, tests, and assginments.
> What I liked least about this course was the weekly quizzes that required readings.
> Nothing, this was actually like the most amazing and structured class with an even better professor, and I don’t even usually like economics!!!
