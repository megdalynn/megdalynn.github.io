Fall Semester (3 cr.)  
This course reinforces and deepens economic skills by applying basic microeconomic concepts
and models to a variety of policy areas. Using economic models, students in the course will
examine the motivation for intervention in the economy, the types of intervention, and the
predicted effects of policies.  
Policy areas covered will include tax, social, health, regulatory, environmental, and trade policy,
among others. To better understand these issues, the course will first briefly discuss some of
the institutional details of the policy area, and then use economic models to examine impact of
policy on behavior and market outcomes.
