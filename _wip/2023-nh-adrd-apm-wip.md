Do nursing home residents with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) receive antipyschotic medications more often than residents with other severe mental illnesses such as diseases that are excluded from public reporting requirements? What disparities in treatment through antipsychotic medications are present in nursing homes? We explore the relationships between ADRD, exclusionary diagnosis, ownership structure, and payment types.
