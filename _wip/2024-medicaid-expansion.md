excerpt: "Medicaid expansion has increased the number of nursing home (NH) residents (Ritter et al, Van Houtven et al) but there is a lack of research on individual level decisions and facilty level reactions. To expand this research base, we examine resident level data to determine how quickly Medicaid expansion leads to changes in the type of long-stay patients in NHs, and how that translates into changes in the characteristics of long-stay residents and NHs over time. We hypothesize that SMI populations under 65 will be the group that experiences the largest increase."
