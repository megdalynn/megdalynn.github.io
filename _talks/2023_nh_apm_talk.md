Following the public reporting of Antipsychotic Medication (APM) use in nursing homes, we document an increase in prevalence of schizophrenia diagnos, a diagnosis which excludes facilities from the public reporting requirement for these residents. Public reporting is designed to reduce off-label use of APMs, increases in schizophrenia diagnosis are an unintended consequence of the policy that may be attributed to either more accurate diagnosis or upcoding.
